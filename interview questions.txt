tell me about yourself: student at GVSU, finishing my undergrad and starting my grad. Someone who loves to learn about software
and thrive under pressure. In my free time, I am learning more about unity, as well as making an AI to practice my skills and beat games that I can't.
Aside from computers, I enjoy exploring grand rapids, and reading.

internship - wasn't able to take the prereq till last semester, couldn't afford it this semester.
